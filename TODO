TODO R package:

 * Read about vignette, what we need to do to convert/use the IRIDIA
   TR as the vignette.

 * Move the README information to the TR to avoid duplication.

TODO General:

 * Make tune-main, tune-main-cluster, tune-main-mpi and other scripts
   use /tmp as much as possible.

 * How to avoid that MPI creates so many log files?

 * irace.Rdata should keep a list with the all the eliteCandidates after each
   race. Right now we only keep the best one.

 * Fix issues with digits, rounding and real parameters. If digits=d,
   perhaps it is more correct to sample like:

   round(rtnorm(1, mean + (10^-d) / 2, lower, upper + 10^-d) - (10^-d)/2, d)

   The same applies to runif().   

 * Reduce the output of the race package. Only report copyright info
   once. Do not duplicate information already given by irace.

 * Handle properly fixed parameters in candidatesFile (see FIXME in
   readConfigurations.R).

 * Add command-line option --cluster=[sge|pbs] to choose the type of
   cluster. Then, hook-run calls qsub and prints a jobID. jobID must
   be a single word ([0-9a-z._-@]+); if not or length(jobID) != 1 or
   exit code is != 0, then complain. The option --cluster only chooses
   which type of qstat command is invoked. This will leave parsing the
   jobID to the user, since it is very fragile. We should put examples
   for PBS and SGE in examples/cluster-mode/.

 * generateCandidatesNormal() takes too much time with >800 candidates
   and >20 parameters (SPEAR testcase).
 
 * Use the options() mechanism of R, that is, 
   options(irace.debug.level = 1) and getOption("irace.debug.level").

 * Implement constraints on values that allow the user to specify
   restrictions on the values that parameters may take, such as all
   candidates must satisfy that a < b. Such constraints would be
   specified in a different file "constraints.txt". One way to handle
   them would be by sampling and rejection but perhaps more effective
   methods could be implemented.

 * JEREMIE: I would like to try a version of I-Race with a kind of
   bounding in the probability vectors, something equivalent somehow
   to MaxMin AS for ACO.  This could be a better way to avoid
   convergence than trying to "flat" the vectors when it is already
   too late.

 * Somehow adapt how many instances should be seen.  Maybe such
   choices should be done based on the perceived heterogeneity of the
   instances; I think this is an issue we also could discuss. I also
   think that one should be able to measure such things e.g. by the
   variability of the results of same configurations or by some
   measure of variation of ranks on instances for each configuration.

 * Various initialization modes Latin Hyper-cube, random, exhaustive,
   etc.

 * If we have too many elites, remove some of them. Add a parameter
   --max-elites.
 
 * Add example of logarithmic/parameter conversions in hook-run.

 * Resample / Randomize only the instances one has seen. When a race
   stops, the instances already seen are randomized but the elite
   configurations are not reevaluated on them.

 * Parameters should be printed and put in the commandline in exactly
   the same order given in the parameter file.

 * oneParamUpperBound and oneParamLowerBound are too much. We can
   have a single function: paramBound that returns 
      return (as.numeric(parameters[["boundary"]][[paramName]]))
   then the user can use directly [1] or [2] to select whatever they
   want. [Jeremie]

 * Forbidden parameter combinations (following ParamILS).

 * Error/Warn about unknown parameters.

 * Error messages start in uppercase and finish with a period.

 * Use tunerError() for user-level errors and irace.assert() for
   internal assertions. All stopfinot() should be irace.assert(). Some
   stop() should be tunerError(), a few should be irace.assert(). None
   of these functions nor cat() require pasting their arguments.

 * Do not add extra parenthesis around simple expressions. Example:
      if ( (!file.exists(installDir)) ) has too many parenthesis.

 * It could be nice to be able to set a different nb of rounding
   digits for each real parameters This number thus would be given in
   the parameters.txt file.  It should require very few
   modifications, only in the sampling (generation uniform and normal)

DONE:

 * [DONE] We should use list$element instead of list[["element"]] for
   indexing elements that must exist. This way if we do a typo, the
   whole thing fails to run instead of just returning
   NULL. Unfortunately, list$__element__ does not work because
   __element__ is not a valid R variable name, so I suggest .ID.,
   which is valid.

 * [DONE] We should produce at least the ouput files in R data format
   using save()
    * A data.frame/matrix with all experiments performed.
    * A data.frame/matrix with all candidate results.
   [Manuel]

 * [FIXED] Use the remaining budget always. But how? 

 * [DONE] Allow to specify candidate configurations. Perhaps from an extra
   input file --candidates=candidates.txt, which gives one candidate
   per line in a table format:

       param1 param2 param3 param4
       10     5      none      8.2
       9      NA     all       8.3

   We would have to check that param names correspond to all
   parameters given in parameters.txt and that constraints are
   satisfied.

 * [DONE] The "c" is not "component" but "categorical". We should rename
   everything Component to Categorical, just use sed, check the diff
   and test. [Jeremie]

 * [DONE] If we want to keep the functions for isReal, isInteger, etc. then
   you should use them everywhere. I would propose to have a paramType
   function that returns the type, and then isReal(type) would just
   test (type == "r"). [Jeremie]

 * [DONE] Replace the constraints specifications by an R expression
   using: eval(parse(text=constraint), list(a=4, b=3))

 * In race.R: 

  - [DONE] I wonder why first.test should be a single number? It seems
    reasonable to choose 10 or more, no? I changed it in the check of
    the variable first.test

  - [DONE] Add a parameter each.test, to set how often the f-test
    should be performed, and the corresponding test. For example, if
    each.test == 10, the f-test will be performed only after having
    seen 10, 20, 30... instances.

 * [DONE] Print elite commandlines (that is, pairs switch-value) for easy
   copy-paste.

 * Remove the c() from all calls to printMsg. [DONE]

 * I think the concept of ghosts parameters could be better handled if
   we track the size of the domain of a parameter. Then, we do not
   sample/update probabilities for parameters whose domain is size
   1. Also, "ghost" is confusing, better would be "Fixed" or "Static".[DONE]

 * Rename everything as irace instead ifrace (only after merging all
   pending branches!). [DONE]
