Iterated F-Race
---------------

Configuration
-------------

* Modify the hook programs in hooks/ following the
  instructions in each file.

* Modify the file TUNE/parameters.txt following the
  instructions there.

* Put the instances in Instances/

* Modify the header of TUNE/tune.sh to be what you want for the
  cluster configuration (queues, etc).

* Modify the variable TUNE_CMD of submitJobs.sh to use or not qsub to
  submit jobs.

* Modify the variable REPETITIONS of submitJobs.sh to specify how many
  repetitions of Iterated F-race will be executed in parallel.

I think this is all for now.  If you find that you need to modify
anything else, something is not clear or if you have problems:
