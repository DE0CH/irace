Iterated F-Race
---------------

Configuration
-------------

* For each template hook (*.tmpl) in hooks/, make a copy removing the
  '.tmpl' suffix, and modify them following the instructions in each
  file.

* Make a copy of the file parameters.tmpl as parameters.txt,
  and modify it following the instructions there.

* Put the instances in Instances/

* Modify the header of TUNE/tune.sh to be what you want for the
  cluster configuration (queues, etc).

* Modify the variable TUNE_CMD of submitJobs.sh to use or not qsub to
  submit jobs.

* Call submitJobs.sh with the number of repetitions of Iterated F-race
  to be executed in parallel.

I think this is all for now.  If you find that you need to modify
anything else, something is not clear or if you have problems:
