Iterated F-Race
---------------

Configuration
-------------

* Create a directory for the tuning, for example "tuning/".

* Copy the files in the hooks/ directory to your tuning/ directory.
  For each template hook (*.tmpl) in your tuning/ directory, remove
  the '.tmpl' suffix, and modify them following the instructions in
  each file. In particular, tune-main.tmpl should be adjusted
  depending on your usage (local, cluster, etc).  The hooks should be
  executable. See the examples in examples/.

* Copy the file parameters.tmpl to your tuning directory as
  parameters.txt, and modify it following the instructions there.

* Put the instances in tuning/Instances/. In addition, you can create
  a file that specifies which instances from that directory should be
  run and which instance-specific parameters to use. See
  tune-conf.tmpl and instances-list.tmpl for examples.

* Copy the file tune-conf.tmpl to your tuning/ directory as tune-conf
  and modify it following the instructions there.

* Call submitjobs.sh from your tuning directory with the number of
  repetitions of Iterated F-race to be executed in parallel. If you
  execute several in your local computer, then you may need to
  redirect the output to a file, either manually or in tune-main.

* Results will appear in tuning/TUNE-dd, where dd is a number. Be
  careful, if you run submitjobs.sh again, these directories will be
  deleted. Check the help of submitjobs.sh by running it without
  parameters.

If you find that you need to modify anything else, something is not
clear or if you have problems: <manuel.lopez-ibanez@ulb.ac.be>
