Iterated F-Race
---------------

Configuration
-------------

* Create a directory for the tuning, for example "tuning/".

* Copy the files in the hooks/ directory to your tuning/ directory.
  For each template hook (*.tmpl) in your tuning/ directory, remove
  the '.tmpl' suffix, and modify them following the instructions in
  each file. In particular, tune-main.tmpl should be adjusted
  depending on your usage (local, cluster, etc).  The hooks should be
  executable. See the examples in examples/.

* Copy the file parameters.tmpl to your tuning directory as
  parameters.txt, and modify it following the instructions there.

* Put the instances in tuning/Instances/. In addition, you can create
  a file that specifies which instances from that directory should be
  run and which instance-specific parameters to use. See
  tune-conf.tmpl and instances-list.tmpl for examples.

* Copy the file tune-conf.tmpl to your tuning/ directory as tune-conf
  and modify it following the instructions there.

* Call ifrace-parallel.sh from your tuning directory with the number of
  repetitions of Iterated F-race to be executed in parallel.

* Results will appear in tuning/TUNE-dd, where dd is a number, as two
  files ifrace-PID.stdout and ifrace-PID.stderr. Be careful, if you
  run ifrace-parallel.sh again, these directories will be deleted.
  Check the help of ifrace-parallel.sh by running it without
  parameters.  In each directory, there will be also two Rdata files:
  fullresults.Rdata and stats.Rdata.  You can examine their contents
  within R with the commands:
  
    load("fullresults.Rdata"); print(fullresults)
  
If you find that you need to modify anything else, something is not
clear or if you have problems: <manuel.lopez-ibanez@ulb.ac.be>
