Iterated F-Race
---------------

Configuration
-------------

* For each template hook (*.tmpl) in hooks/, make a copy removing the
  '.tmpl' suffix, and modify them following the instructions in each
  file. See the examples in hooks/examples/. The hooks should be
  executable.

* Make a copy of the file parameters.tmpl as parameters.txt,
  and modify it following the instructions there.

* Put the instances in Instances/

* Make a copy of TUNE/tune-main.tmpl to TUNE/tune-main and adjust it
  depending on your usage (local, cluster, etc). See the examples in
  hooks/examples/tune-main-*. TUNE/tune-main should be executable.

* Call submitJobs.sh with the number of repetitions of Iterated F-race
  to be executed in parallel.

I think this is all for now.  If you find that you need to modify
anything else, something is not clear or if you have problems:
