Iterated F-Race
---------------

Configuration
-------------

* Create a directory for the tuning, for example "tuning/".

* Copy the files in the hooks/ directory to your tuning/ directory.
  For each template hook (*.tmpl) in your tuning/ directory, remove
  the '.tmpl' suffix, and modify them following the instructions in
  each file. In particular, tune-main.tmpl should be adjusted
  depending on your usage (local, cluster, etc).  The hooks should be
  executable. See the examples in examples/.

* Copy the file parameters.tmpl to your tuning directory as
  parameters.txt, and modify it following the instructions there.

* Put the instances in tuning/Instances/

* Copy the file tune-conf.tmpl to your tuning/ directory as tune-conf
  and modify it following the instructions there.

* Call submitJobs.sh from your tuning directory with the number of
  repetitions of Iterated F-race to be executed in parallel.

* Results will appear in tuning/TUNE-dd, where dd is a number.
